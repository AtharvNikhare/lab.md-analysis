this folder contains various radial bond tests. Data was manualy collected from both Next Gen MW and Legacy MW from different test circumstances and graphed on both the time and frequency domain. each image(in figures folder) shows two plots. the top plot is the time energy data for both Legacy MW and next gen MW. It displays the total energy (te) potential energy (pe) and the kinetic energy (ke).
